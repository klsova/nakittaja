# Nakittaja
Nakittaja is a web application made for enabling students to voluteer for different kinds of events
Built on a Django backend and Next.js frontend
# TODO:
- Implement a login system
- Create a database for storing the data of said system
- Make the site overall good

This will probably be a long project and the end goal for me is to be able actually provide this service to the students of UTU
